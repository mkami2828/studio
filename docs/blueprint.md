# **App Name**: ImageForge AI

## Core Features:

- Text-to-Image Generation: Generate images based on user prompts using the Pollinations AI API. Users can input text, and the AI generates a corresponding image.
- Parameter Customization: Allow users to adjust parameters like width, height, and seed for image generation for precise output control, all within the UI.
- Transparent Background Generation: Leverage the 'gptimage' model to create images with transparent backgrounds for specific use cases like logos. The tool may conditionally decide to apply or not apply the background.
- Image-to-Image Generation: Implement image-to-image generation using the 'kontext' model, enabling users to upload an image and a text prompt to generate variations or modifications.
- Image Display & Download: Display generated images with options to download them in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG).
- Error Handling: Display any error messages from the Pollinations API to the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) which converts to RGB Hex value #3685ef for a modern, technological feel.

- Accent color: An analogous color to the primary at HSL(180, 60%, 40%), which converts to RGB Hex value #329da8, provides interactive cues.

- Design a clean, intuitive layout that is easy to navigate, with a prominent area for displaying generated images.
